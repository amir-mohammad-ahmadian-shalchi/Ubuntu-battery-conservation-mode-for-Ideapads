# Ubuntu battery conservation mode for Ideapads
**Alpha version** 

Since there is not any Lenovo Power Management in Ubuntu, conservation mode can not be activated in an Ideapad easily. But I created a file that can activate it easily! and it is more user friendly! I hope you enjoy it.

# Description
This file requires you to enter your password because it can only work in root mode.
I tested it on my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad z510) and it worked correctly. Please follow the instructions to prevent errors.

# Installation
Step 1: Please make sure you have the acpi-call-dkms package installed. <br />
Step 2: Extract the file. <br />
Step 3: Open terminal and navigate to the directory that you extracted. <br />
Step 4: Please write this command in terminal to make the file executable. <br />
```bash
chmod +x conservation-mode
```
Step 5: Run the file. <br />
```bash
./conservation-mode
```
